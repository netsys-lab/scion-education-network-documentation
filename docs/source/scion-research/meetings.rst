SCION Research Meetings
=======================================

With the growing global community of researchers working on SCION-related topics and the steadily increasing deployment of the SCION infrastructure, we are starting a weekly research meeting inviting all interested researchers to participate. We will be discussing current research results, as well as promising future directions.

The meetings take place every week and usually last around 30min. To accommodate participation of SCION researchers from all around the world, the meeting time alternates every other week:

- *Even* weeks: Tuesday 9am CET, 3pm CST, 4pm KST / JST, (12am PT) 
- *Odd* weeks: Wednesday 5pm CET, 8am PT, 11am ET, 12pm BRT, (11pm CST, 12am KST / JST)

The SCION research meetings are open for anyone interested in discussing research topics related to SCION, including but not limited to:

- Next-generation Internet architecture research
- Path-aware networking
- Network availability and performance measurements over the SCION network
- Applications leveraging supported SCION features (PKI, DDoS defense mechanisms, path selection support, end host / application support)
- (Security) Usability research
- Inter-domain routing scalability research
- Multi-path communication
- Scalable inter-domain bandwidth allocation systems, QoS
- DDoS defense research using in-network defense mechanisms
- Next-generation routing architecture policy definitions
- Secure communication in specific domains, e.g., cloud, IoT

If you are interested to present your SCION research work during one of the upcoming meetings, please submit your talk proposal to: https://sessionize.com/scion-research

Talk proposals will be reviewed by a review committee.

Talks usually last 10-15 minutes, leaving 15-20 minutes for discussion.
